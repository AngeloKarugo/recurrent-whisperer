# RecurrentWhisperer - A general class template for training recurrent neural networks using Tensorflow.

## Prerequisites

The code is written in Python 2.7.6. You will also need:

* **TensorFlow** version 1.10 ([install](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/))
* **NumPy and SciPy** ([install SciPy stack](https://www.scipy.org/install.html), contains both)
* **PyYaml** ([install](https://pyyaml.org))

## Getting started

See [FlipFlop.py](https://github.com/mattgolub/fixed-point-finder/blob/master/example/FlipFlop.py) for an example subclass that inherits from RecurrentWhisperer for the purposes of training an RNN to implement an N-bit memory.
